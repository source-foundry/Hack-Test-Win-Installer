# Hack Test Windows Installer

A Windows installer for test (Development/Beta) builds of the [Hack](https://github.com/source-foundry/Hack/) typeface.

The test fonts are named "Test" ("Hack Test") and use different font file names as the [stable/tested release](https://github.com/source-foundry/Hack-windows-installer). **It is therefore safe to install both versions on the same device** and help us improving Hack.

If you find any display issue with *Hack Test*, please open an issue at the [Hack repository](https://github.com/source-foundry/Hack/).

If you find any installation releated issues, please open an issue at the [Hack Windows Installer repository](https://github.com/source-foundry/Hack-windows-installer/issues).
